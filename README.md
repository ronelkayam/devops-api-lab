# Mini API Repo

**A small DevOps course repository for students to practice Git, Python, and API calls using `requests`.**

This repository contains a simple Python project and exercises designed for DevOps students to learn:

- Git commands (clone, branch, commit, push)
- Working with APIs in Python
- Hands-on coding exercises in groups

## Setup

1. Clone the repository:

bash
git clone <your-repo-URL>
cd mini-api-repo
Install dependencies (run once in your Python terminal):

bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
Run the demo to see how the code works:

bash
python demo.py
Workflow for Exercises
Create a branch for your work:

bash
git checkout -b your-branch-name
Work on the exercises using Python and APIClient.

Commit your changes:

bash
git add .
git commit -m "Your commit message"
Push your branch to your own GitHub repository:

bash
git push origin your-branch-name
Important: Do not send a Pull Request to main of the original repo.
Instead, push everything to your own repository and share the repository link with the instructor.
